	<h1>The Tragedy of the Poacher</h1>
	
	<h1>Cause and Effect Model</h1>

  	<p>This model demonstrates the cause and effect system that is created by zoos, a topic that falls in the category of animal abuse. It is not the main topic that we decided to create our video on, but it certainly pertains to the message of helping animals. </p>
<h1>Storyboard</h1>
	  <img src="Storyboard.PNG" alt="Storyboard">
  	<p>I worked on every scene, instructing my teammates on how to move the figures to make each scene flow relatively smoothly. For example, in the scene where the boss man is riding the rhinoceros around, I used the onion feature to make sure that new slides lined up perfectly with older ones. I created the rhino, and I helped refine the humans because at first they were more clumps than people. </p>
<h1>Set Design</h1>

  <img src="ex2.PNG" alt="Character Set">
  	<p>These are some the images that inspired our design, as well as the final products that we ourselves created. We used these designs to create the story we wanted to tell.</p>
<h1>Other Technology Used</h1>

  	<p>I created the sound for the intro, on the coding software we learned one class. I was also in charge of operating the interface to take the pictures, as well as edit the frames we already had. I was in charge of clicking the button to take the pictures between frames, and I was in charge of positioning the  If there was a hand in the frame, I would take it out, and if we needed something to loop or last longer I was the person to figure that out.</p>
<h1>Video</h1>

<p>Our project will create the feeling that poaching is wrong because of how innocent and humane the animals look. To create this feeling, we gave them googly eyes, a feature that usually only people have. Our story of a boss of a poaching business realizing how bad it is to poach, and getting a different job. The video will show the audience how morally wrong poaching is, and that there needs to be action taken to stop it. </p>
